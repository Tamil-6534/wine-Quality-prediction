# wine-Quality-prediction
This project focuses on predicting the quality of red and white wine using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to analyze physicochemical properties of wine and build models that can accurately predict wine quality using both regression and classification approaches.
The dataset includes attributes such as acidity, sugar content, pH, alcohol percentage, and other chemical properties for both red and white wine samples.


-> Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships
Preprocess data including handling missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting
Compare different machine learning algorithms for wine quality prediction
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics for regression and classification


🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

🔹 Regression Models

Linear Regression
Used to predict the continuous wine quality score based on input features.

KNN Regressor
Predicts wine quality by averaging the quality of the nearest neighboring samples.

🔹 Classification Models

* Logistic Regression
Used to classify wine quality into quality categories (e.g., good vs bad).

* KNN Classifier
Classifies wine quality based on the majority class among nearest neighbors.
